Hi team, I am adding just a short description for each file present in the project:

Diabetic_data.csv : This is the original data set on which all analysis has been performed.

cleaned_diabetic_data_final_V.csv: This is file on which all data cleaning and prepping has happened and then saved to a csv, it 
is the base that we use for all EDA and machine learning.

Healthbeacon Project Final.twbx: This is the Tableau file with interactive visualizations for the project containing visuals which
I thought we best suited.

Report_Final.pdf: The final report detailing main insights and some strategic reccomendations for bussiness use cases
(2 pages)

Main.ipynb: The main python notebook which has all EDA code and machine learning code as well. I have tried to add comments 
as frequently as I could to explain the steps!
